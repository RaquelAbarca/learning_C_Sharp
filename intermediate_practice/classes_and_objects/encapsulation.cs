/*
Part of the meaning of the word encapsulation is the idea of "surrounding" an entity, not just to keep what's inside together, but also to protect it.

In programming, encapsulation means more than simply combining members together within a class; it also means restricting access to the inner workings of that class.

Encapsulation is implemented by using access modifiers. An access modifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member.

Encapsulation is also called information hiding.

C# supports the following access modifiers: public, private, protected, internal, protected internal.

 ~ The public access modifier makes the member accessible from the outside of the class. 

 ~ The private access modifier makes members accessible only from within the class and hides them from the outside.

            b.Deposit(199);
            b.Withdraw(42);

/*
We used encapsulation to hide the balance member from the outside code. Then we provided restricted access to it using public methods. The class data can be read through the GetBalance method and modified only through the Deposit and Withdraw methods.

You cannot directly change the balance variable. You can only view its value using the public method. This helps maintain data integrity.

We could add different verification and checking mechanisms to the methods to provide additional security and prevent errors.

In summary, the benefits of encapsulation are:

- Control the way data is accessed or modified.

- Code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.

- Change one part of code without affecting other parts of code.
