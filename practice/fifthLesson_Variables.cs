/*
Rules of Naming Variables
Let's talk about names.

There are several naming rules that you need to follow in C#:

variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore
variable names cannot contain spaces
variable names can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores
C# is case-sensitive, which means that, for example, Name and name variables are different
C# keywords can't be used as variable names. A keyword is a word that is part of the C# language
ðŸ’¡It's very important to use variable names that are descriptive, which makes the code more understandable.
