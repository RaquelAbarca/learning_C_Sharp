using System;  //Namespaces are used to organize and provide code separation. They categorize different elements by putting related members in the same namespace. Definds the System namespace with the using keyword.
// Namespaces are not mandatory in a C# program, but they do play an important role in writing cleaner code and managing larger projects.

public class Program

    }

// Also, for example, not defining the System namespace will require writing System.Console.WriteLine instead of Console.WriteLine every time. So, basically, using a namespace is shorthand and makes the code more readable.
